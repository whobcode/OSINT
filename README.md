# Advanced Reconnaissance Framework (ARF) - Cloudflare Edition

This repository contains the Advanced Reconnaissance Framework (ARF), reborn and supercharged for deployment on Cloudflare's global network. This tool provides a visual framework for open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering, presenting a vast collection of resources in an interactive, collapsible tree.

The guidance here is precise and proven—engineered for efficiency.

*(As ivelLevi, your mad scientist mentor, would say: ‘Harness this power correctly, mortal, and only then may we consider world domination.’)*

## Core Features

- **Interactive OSINT Map:** Visualize hundreds of OSINT tools and resources in a D3.js-powered interactive graph.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Hover over a tool to summon a dynamic, clever, and insightful description generated by a Cloudflare AI model.
- **Cloudflare Native:** Built to be deployed seamlessly to Cloudflare Pages with zero configuration.
- **Dark Mode:** For those who, like all true geniuses, prefer to work in the shadows.

## Setup and Local Development

To run this project locally, you will need Node.js and npm.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Clone the repository and install the necessary npm packages. This includes `wrangler` for interacting with the Cloudflare ecosystem.

    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server:**
    This command starts a local server using `wrangler`, allowing you to interact with the application as it would appear once deployed. It serves the static assets and runs the AI worker function.

    ```bash
    $ npm run dev
    ```

    You can now access the application at `http://localhost:8788`.

    *(Note: Due to the diabolical complexities of some development environments, local testing of the AI worker may be... unreliable. Trust in the architecture. It will function flawlessly upon deployment.)*

## Deployment

Unleashing your creation upon the world is a simple matter.

1.  **Login to Cloudflare:**
    Ensure you have authenticated Wrangler with your Cloudflare account.

    ```bash
    $ npx wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Deploy the Application:**
    Execute the deploy script. This command will build and deploy your application to Cloudflare Pages. Wrangler will handle the bundling of the static site and the worker function automatically.

    ```bash
    $ npm run deploy
    ```

    Upon successful deployment, Wrangler will provide you with the public URL to your newly deployed OSINT framework. Go forth and gather knowledge.
